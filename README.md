# Forest

This is an initial attempt to conceptualize a ‘social’ platform specifically designed for environmentalists and activists. The objective is to provide a more unified and integrated platform for them to collaborate on shared concerns related to both current and future environmental issues. On the front-end, I’m opting for an app-based user interface instead of a page-by-page approach. On the back-end, I’m deliberately segregating data from user to user for future security and compartmentalization implementations.

All of this, to date, serves as a proof of concept. Thorough refactoring and alpha testing will follow accordingly.
